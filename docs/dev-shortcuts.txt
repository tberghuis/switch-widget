do this wrong hardcoded
then google assistant integration.


getMaxShortcutCountPerActivity = 15 for poco F3

implement deeplink
switchwidget://switchwidget/<switch_id>/<action>

create a website to open deeplinks
  https://deeplink.tberghuis.dev/switchwidget://switchwidget/<switch_id>/<action>

google assistant create routine
  "pool on" -> https://deeplink.tberghuis.dev/switchwidget://switchwidget/1/ON

see if website is possible with noteboat demo

1st try
https://switchwidget.tberghuis.dev/<entity_id>/<action>
  github pages hash routing.... probably don't need to worry about 404 without hash?
  android app links
  see if google assistant will directly open the app
  is there some sort of qualification process as any app could try to handle any domain???
    configure DNS server with google config data?

###############
1. create switch-widget-tmp.tberghuis.dev
...
app links docs
...
https://developer.android.com/studio/write/app-link-indexing

google assistant routine
  "open https://switch-widget-tmp.tberghuis.dev/<entity_id>/<action>"

if it does not work, code deeplink.tberghuis.dev, settimeout open switch-widget-tmp.tberghuis.dev/<entity_id>/<action> in tab...
  i think i might need to wait for google assistant to index assetlinks.json
  and play console manifest.xml
  and google to index website

last resort deeplink.tberghuis.dev
  "hey google, deep links" (routine https://deeplink.tberghuis.dev)
  mobile friendly web page or instant app
  list of deep links, target=_blank

App link in fresh activity run task in work manager or short service
  short foreground service can probably emit a "Toast"
  Activity.finish()

next task
do the action
check the DB for entityId and action
